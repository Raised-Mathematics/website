We provide BRF (a file format that is used by all the embossers) files for the Abstract Algebra textbook. The book, available [on the web](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata.html) and [as a PDF file](http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/download.html), has been converted to Braille, using Nemeth Braille conventions for mathematics. The textbook is an open-source text. All the source files for it can be found on [github](https://github.com/twjudson/aata). 

The Braille version of the textbook is quite long. The most recent PDF file for the textbook has nearly 400 pages, and the Braille version has about 1700 Braille pages. For this reason, we split the text by chapters.
